## Welcome!

I am an ecologist/data scientist interested in conservation biology, spatial analysis, and human-environment interactions. I am currently working for the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) as a Land Resource Specialist.

This website describes a bit about who I am, the research I do and the questions Iâ€™m interested in.

If you want to drop me a line, please get in touch at chris.j.blackford@gmail.com

If you are looking for a specific project you can check out the research tab above or check out my [github page](github.com/Christopher-Blackford).
